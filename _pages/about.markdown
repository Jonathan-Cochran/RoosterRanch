Welcome to Rooster Ranch, nestled in the heart of Sunbury, Ohio, on a lively 20-acre plot. We're the Cochrans - Jonathan, Alison, and our three budding ranchers, Justin, Kylie, and Lindsey. Our days are filled with the clucks of chickens, the hops of rabbits, and the playful prowls of barn cats, all under the watchful eye of Maggie, our gentle Great Pyrenees.

Our kids, all proud 4-H members and spirited athletes at Big Walnut, help us tend to the ranch with the same enthusiasm they bring to the sports field. When we're not tending to our animal companions or cheering on the sidelines, weâ€™re jotting down tales and tips from the ranch. Our first venture into the literary world is a book on lawn care, with more to come.

Rooster Ranch is our little slice of paradise where nature, laughter, and the occasional rabbit chase reign supreme. We offer fresh eggs, tender rabbit meat, seasonal veggies, and a glimpse into our wholesome, sometimes whimsical, rural life.

Feel free to roam around our website, explore our offerings, and reach out to cluck hello! Our nest is always open to friends, both feathered and not.
